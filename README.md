# Chatbot
A list of chatbot programs to run like rule based and NLP based
## Rulebase_Chatbot
- A Rule-Based Chatbot works by following predefined rules to respond to user queries. It matches keywords in the user's input with specific intents, and then provides a corresponding response based on the matched intent.

#### How It Works
1. Query Matching: The chatbot searches for keywords in the user's query.

2. Intent Mapping: Keywords are mapped to intents (e.g., "hello" ‚Üí greetings).

3. Response Generation: The chatbot selects a response from the matched intent.

##### Example:
- User: "Hello"
- Bot: "Hi, how can I assist you today?"


#### Limitations
- Limited Flexibility: It only works for exact matches and can't handle varied phrasing without predefined rules.

- Scalability: It‚Äôs difficult to manage as the number of keywords and responses increases.

#### Improvements
- Phrase Matching: Match phrases, not just individual words, for better user interaction.

- Best Intent: Choose the most relevant intent when multiple matches occur.

- Fallback: Provide a default response when no intent is matched.

#### Structure
1. Keywords & Intent Mapping: Define keywords (e.g., "hello") and their corresponding intents (e.g., greetings).

2. Intent & Response Mapping: Each intent has multiple possible responses.
#### Output


## RNN Based Chatbot
### ü§ñ RNN Chatbot ‚Äì Import/Export Assistant

This is a simple **RNN-style chatbot** that acts as an import/export assistant. It uses a corpus file (`import_export_knowledge.txt`) and natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries intelligently.

#### üîç Rule-based vs. RNN-style Chatbot

| Rule-Based Chatbot | RNN-Style Chatbot |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Works on predefined rules | Learns from patterns in data |
| Matches keywords to fixed responses | Understands query context |
| No learning involved | Uses NLP for dynamic responses |
| Random or template-based answers | Responses based on vector similarity |

#### üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Uses a static corpus file (e.g., `import_export_knowledge.txt`). You can also extend it to use internet-based or user-generated data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - ‚úÖ **Letter Conversion**
   - ‚úÖ **Tokenization**
   - ‚úÖ **Noise Removal**
   - ‚úÖ **Stop Words Removal**
   - ‚úÖ **Lemmatization**

3. **Encoding with TF-IDF**: Converts user queries into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. **Similarity Matching**: Uses **Cosine Similarity** to compare user queries to the corpus and retrieve the most relevant response.

#### üìÑ Corpus File
Make sure this file is in the **same directory** as your Python chatbot script.
