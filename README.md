# Rulebase_Chatbot
- A Rule-Based Chatbot works by following predefined rules to respond to user queries. It matches keywords in the user's input with specific intents, and then provides a corresponding response based on the matched intent.

#### How It Works
1. Query Matching: The chatbot searches for keywords in the user's query.

2. Intent Mapping: Keywords are mapped to intents (e.g., "hello" → greetings).

3. Response Generation: The chatbot selects a response from the matched intent.

##### Example:
- User: "Hello"
- Bot: "Hi, how can I assist you today?"

#### When to Use
Rule-based chatbots are great for controlled environments like:

- Ticketing Systems

- Medical Assistance

- Delivery Apps

#### Limitations
- Limited Flexibility: It only works for exact matches and can't handle varied phrasing without predefined rules.

- Scalability: It’s difficult to manage as the number of keywords and responses increases.

#### Improvements
- Phrase Matching: Match phrases, not just individual words, for better user interaction.

- Best Intent: Choose the most relevant intent when multiple matches occur.

- Fallback: Provide a default response when no intent is matched.

#### Structure
1. Keywords & Intent Mapping: Define keywords (e.g., "hello") and their corresponding intents (e.g., greetings).

2. Intent & Response Mapping: Each intent has multiple possible responses.
